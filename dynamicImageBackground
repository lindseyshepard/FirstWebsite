Lines 14 to 23 is how I was able to change the focus of the background photo depending on device. I tried to do this in 
JavaScript on another project. That will be my next personal challenge. If anyone see's a way I can make this better,
cleaner in anyway please message me!

            Hello, world! <br>
            I want to tell you a little about me.
            From my background picture you can see I like to explore. Now I am ready to explore the next step.
            <br><br>
            Mid 2019, I began a new chapter of my life by participating in Microsofts Software and Systems Academy
            (<a href="https://military.microsoft.com/programs/microsoft-software-systems-academy/" target="_blank">MSSA</a>)
            for Cloud Development. This was exciting and scary at the same time because I never explored software
            development. Early 2019, I transitioned out of the United States Marine Corps. I found this opportunity to
            enroll in the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy (MSSA) and my life changed. I discovered a new
            challenge, but also found my passion: <b>innovation</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Innovation is a term used in the technology field and in our daily lives, but what exactly does it mean?<br>


            New ideas immerge every day; in every area of day-to-day life and cannot be limited by today's data discovery.

            Technology is not limited. There is a form of innovation at every
            corner. New ideas are influencing retail, aviation, transportation, and even how we order our coffee. I have been asked, "Why Tech?"
            The reasons are diverse, but my answer is simple: I want to join an industry full of passion, with intent to better the lives of everyone.
            <br><br>



            •	 I could develop an application that can save a working parent five minutes on a busy morning.
            <br>
            •    I could help a doctor or nurse work more efficiently with something I helped create.
            <br>
            •    I could implement security features in online banking software.


            <br><br>
            I realize these ideas are ambitious for someone so new to the industry, but my desire to learn, grow, and collaborate can get me there.
            With my enthusiasm to innovate, I can have an impact in such a fast-paced industry. As a positive, optimistic individual, I am excited
            to enter the technology field and work with other like-minded people.
